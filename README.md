**Sr. Infrastructure Developer at Cognizant**

üåü Unleashing Innovation in ServiceNow

- üöÄ Architecting Success: Imagine leading a team that transforms ordinary ServiceNow instances into streamlined powerhouses. That's what I do! As the captain of the "Back to Standard" project, I spearheaded a revolution, trimming excess customizations, supercharging system performance, and aligning it with industry best practices.

- üí° Elevating Experiences: Ever upgraded an operating system? Now imagine doing it seamlessly for a global enterprise. As a key player in the "Tokoya Upgrade" project, I ensured a silky-smooth transition to the latest ServiceNow version, taking user experiences to new heights.

- ü§ù Collaborative Genius: I don't work in isolation. I orchestrate cross-functional symphonies to conquer project milestones. My secret sauce? Cultivating a culture of continuous learning and innovation that fuels a dynamic and high-performing team.

- üìà Measurable Magic: Results talk! I've waved my wand and optimized ServiceNow instances for peak performance, unwavering stability, and limitless scalability. Disruptions? We don't know them.

Now, I'm on a mission to redefine ServiceNow with process automation, cutting-edge integration, Active Directory (AD) magic, and a pinch of predictive intelligence. Let's connect, and together, we can script the future of ServiceNow!
